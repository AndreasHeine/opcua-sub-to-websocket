Example:

Server-Event at 13:48:11.485364
Client received it and send it out at 13:48:11.503316

+ 0.017952s (Processing time for async_client.py with two ws_client.py instances on localhost, this will grow depending on you network and the number of connected clients)

Websocket-Client reseived it at 13:48:11.503316

+ 0.0 (this will grow depending on you network if you dont use localhost)

Result:
-no dataloss
-really small delay
-websocket-clients receiving same data

Setup:
    opcua_server.py: cmd
    async_client.py: VS Code run in debug
    ws_client.py: both cmd
